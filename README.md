# Automatic Text Evaluation on Data Catalog in Equinorüîç
This project aims to develop an application that can quality ensure data catalog entries based on a set standard to ensure accurate, complete, and reliable documentation. The metadata of data products in Equinor's data platform are stored in a data catalog, and it is essential to ensure that the information captured is up to a certain standard to minimize risk and additional work for anyone using the data product.

# Problem
As more data products are developed, different people interpret and approach documentation differently, resulting in mixed results. This inconsistency poses a problem as it affects the trust in data products. Hence, there is a need to create a process that can quality ensure the existing documentation and support creators of catalog entries to enter the required information based on a set standard.

# Task Description
The project will be developed in a design thinking process. The primary objective is to develop an application that can quality ensure data catalog entries based on a set standard. The following user stories have been identified for this project:

- As a data product owner, I want to know if my documents meet a set standard described through a best practice document.
- As a data steward, I want to receive feedback after adding a data catalog description, stating what is missing.
# Technology
This project will use various technologies to achieve its objective, including Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The project will be developed using Python programming language.

# How to Use
This project is currently under development. Once completed, users can access the application via an API. The API will provide access to data catalog entries and generate feedback reports based on the set standard.
